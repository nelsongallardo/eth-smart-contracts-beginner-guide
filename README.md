### Tools needed

* **[Alchemy](https://alchemyapi.io/eth)**: A development platform and API that allows to make requests to the Ethereum blockchain without having to run a node
* **[Metamask](https://metamask.io/)**: an ethereum wallet that is also a browser plugin that let me use the Ethereum Mainnet to use dApps. It also allows me to use other networks to test without spending real gas in the Mainnet
* **Hardhat/Truffle**: development environment to debug, compile, deploy, etc. (see IDEs section)
* **Editor**: could be vsCode


### IDEs

- [Hardhat documentation on deploying your contracts](https://hardhat.org/guides/deploying.html)
- [Truffle documentation on networks and app deployment](https://www.trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/advanced/networks-and-app-deployment)
